### Add a passenger feature

The command Add a passenger adds passenger details of a particular passenger to the passenger list.

**Overview of relevant classes**

**_NOTE:_** Minimal representation of structure of `AddPassengerCommand`

![class diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/passengerAddCmdClassDiagram.jpg)

When the main class `SkyControl` receives a user input, it parses the input with the
help of the `Parser` class which then forwards the input to the `Passenger Parser` class accordingly.
The `Passenger Parser` retrieves the command `AddPassengerCommand` and returns it to `SkyControl` where
further methods will be triggered as explained below.

**Sequence Diagram**

**_NOTE:_** Exceptions are omitted for readability. 

![sequence diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/passengerAddCmdSeqDiagram.jpg)

1. Once the `AddPassengerCommand` is instantiated, the `execute` method is called from the `SkyControl` 
class with passenger list and user input as method parameters.
2. Within `AddPassengerCommand` the method `getPassengerDetail(String lineInput)` is called to extract the String 
consisting of passenger details from the line input.
3. `AddPassengerCommand` then calls the method `addOperation(String passengerDetail)` within the `PassengerList` class.
4. `getPassengerDetails(String passengerDetail)` method then extracts each of the passenger detail into an attribute in 
the `PassengerList` class
5. `passenger` object of the class `PassengerInfo` is instantiated using the attributes retrieved from the method in 
Step 4. The `passenger` object is then added to the list of passengers
6. `Ui` class level method `showAddedPassenger(PassengerInfo passenger)` is used to display to the user that passenger
has been added to the list successfully.

### Delete a passenger feature 

<div align="justify">  

A delete function that removes a passenger's detail from the passenger's log book is 
facilitated by `DeletePassengerCommand`. It extends an abstract `Command` with an override method called `execute`.
The abstract `Command` extends a `Parser` which holds and validates the User input to determine the type of command.  

</div>  

Furthermore, `DeletePassengerCommand` implements the following operation:  
* `execute(OperationList passengers, String lineInput)` &#8594; An override method inherited from `command` 
to execute the delete operation that should remove a passenger from the logbook  

<div align="justify">  
The class diagram as depicted below shows the behaviour of the passenger delete operation explained in two parts.  
This scenario assumes that the manager have input a valid `passenger delete` command for easier readability.  
</div>  


Part 1: 
* The valid `passenger delete` command is passed as a `String lineInput` into the function `parse` to valid 
the type of command that needs to be executed.
* Once validated, a new Command called `DeletePassengerCommand` should be instantiated.

![class diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/passengerdltcmdClassDiagram_0.jpg)

Part 2:
* `DeletePassengerCommand` would then call `execute(passengers, lineInput)`, 
associating itself with PassengerList to obtain the existing `ArrayList<FlightInfo> passengers`.
* From there, `deleteOperation` method would run within method `execute` and terminate only when there is no such passenger
found or when a passenger is removed.


![class diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/passengerdltcmdClassDiagram_1.jpg)

**Sequence diagram**

![sequence diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/passengerDeleteCmdSeqDiagram.jpg)

When `paser` verifies that the command is an entity `passenger` and `delete` operation,
`DeletePassengerCommend` is instantiated.  
1. `execute(passenger, lineInput)` will run within `DeletePassengerCommend` 
which in turn would call on `deleteOperation(passengerDetail)` in `PassengerList` class.
2. Within `deleteOperation(passengerDetail)`, it would loop the arraylist `passengers` obtained from `OperationList`.
3. If passenger is found, delete object `passenger` from `passengers`. ELse, return without deletion.

### List passengers feature

<div align="justify">  

A list function lists out all passengers' details in table form which is facilitated by `ListPassengerCommand`. It extends an abstract `Command` with an override method called `execute`.
The abstract `Command` extends a `Parser` which holds and validates the User input to determine the type of command.

</div>  

Furthermore, `ListPassengerCommand` implements the following operation:
* `execute(OperationList passengers, String lineInput)` &#8594; An override method inherited from `command` 
to execute the list operation that should list out all the passengers from the logbook.

<div align="justify">  
The class diagram as depicted below shows the behaviour of the passenger list operation explained in two parts.  
This scenario assumes that the manager have input a valid `passenger list` command for easier readability.  
</div>

Part 1:  

* The valid `passenger list` command is passed as a `String lineInput` into the function `parse` to valid
  the type of command that needs to be executed.
* Once validated, a new Command called `ListPassengerCommand` should be instantiated.  

![class diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/passengerListcmdClassDiagram_0.jpg)  

Part 2:  

* `ListPassengerCommand` would then call `execute(passengers, lineInput)`,
  associating itself with PassengerList to obtain the existing `ArrayList<FlightInfo> passengers`.
* From there, `listOperation` method would run within method `execute` and
prints out all `passengers` details on a table format.

![class diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/passengerListcmdClassDiagram_1.jpg)


**Sequence diagram**

![sequence diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/passengerListcmdSeqDiagram.jpg)  

When `paser` verifies that the command is an entity `passenger` and `list` operation,
`ListPassengerCommend` is instantiated.  
1. `execute(passenger, lineInput)` will run within `ListPassengerCommend`
   which in turn would call on `listOperation()` in `PassengerList` class.
2. Within `listOperation()`, it would first check if arraylist `passengers` obtained 
from `OperationList` is empty or not.
3. If `passengers` is empty, prints empty table, else prints respective passenger details in table form.

### Add a flight feature

The Add a flight function adds a flight with its corresponding details to the flight list.

**Sequence Diagram**

**_NOTE:_** Exceptions are omitted for readability.

![sequence diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/flightAddCmdSeqDiagram.jpg)

When the `Parser` recognizes the `add flight` command, `AddFlightCommand` is instantiated.
1. The `AddFlightCommand` then implements a new `addOperation(lineInput:String)` in `FlightList`
2. `FlightList` then instantiates the `FlightInfo` Object using the attributes retrieved from the 
user input in the previous step.
3. `Ui` class level method `showFlightAddedMessage()` is used to inform the user they have added a flight.


---

### Delete a flight feature

A delete function which allows the user to delete a flight specified with its flight number and
departure time from the flight list.

This feature is facilitated by `DeleteFlightCommand`. It extends an abstract `Command` with an override
method `execute`. The abstract `Command` extends a `Parser` which holds and validates the User input
to determine the type of command.

`DeleteFlightCommand` implements the following operation:
* execute(OperationList flights, String lineInput) &#8594; An override method inherited from
`command` to execute the delete operation that should delete the specified flight from the logbook.

The sequence diagram shown below describes the behaviour of the flight delete operation. This scenario
assumes that the manager has given a valid 'flight delete' command as an input for easier readability.

**Sequence Diagram**

![sequence diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/flightDeleteCmdSeqDiagram.jpg)

Assuming that the manager has entered a valid 'flight delete' command, `parser()` will verify that the command
is an entity `flight` and a `delete` operation. `executeEntity()` runs within SkyControl which will
create an instantiation of `DeleteFlightCommand`.

1. `execute(flights, lineInput)` will run within `DeleteFlightCommand` which calls
`deleteOperation(lineInput)` in `FlightList` class.
2. Within `deleteOperaton(lineInput)`, it will check whether the flight number given is valid or not.
3. Given a valid flight number, `findAndRemoveFlight(flightNumber)` will search through the entire arraylist `flights`
to find if the flight number exists and remove it from the arraylist.
4. Upon successful deletion, `showFlightRemovedMessage()` is called which prints a message to the user to indicate a successful
delete operation

### List flights feature

The list function lists out all flight details in a table form which is facilitated by `ListFlightCommand`. 
It extends an abstract `Command` class with an override method called `execute`.

![sequence diagram](../docs/ug-diagrams/images/flightListCmdSeqDiagram.jpg)

When the `Parser` recognizes the `flight list` command, `ListFlightCommand` is instantiated.

1. The `ListFlightCommand` would call on the `listOperation()` method in the `FlightList`. 
2. In turn, the method calls `showListOfFlights` in the Ui class. It calls `checkEmptyFlightList` to check if the flight OperationList is empty.
3. If the `numOfFlights == 0`, an empty table is printed. Else, it would print the respective flight details in a table form.
